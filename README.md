<br></br>

## Project Summary

Project developed under the Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design which consisted in redesigning IMDb’s website, for desktop and mobile, in order to enhance the website's usability and navigation capabilities, reinvent the Company’s brand and increase the number of registered users and active participants.

To redesign the navigation, search, homepage, movie page and celebrity page, I mapped out the following strategy:

* Research (Benchmarking Analysis, SWOT Analysis, Proto-personas);
* Interaction Design (User Flows, Documenting the current website’s Information Architecture and Content Inventory – as-is analysis –, new Information Architecture, Wireframes);
* Rebranding;
* User Interface Design (Mockups Design and non-functional Prototype).

## Project Case Study

### Context

IMDb was first built in 1990, as a hobby, by a group of international tv and movies aficionados. Currently, it is the world's most popular and comprehensive internet source for finding information on movies, TV shows and celebrity related content.

According to Alexa, in October 2016, IMDb was the 57th most visited website in the world and number 1 movie website, with a combined web and mobile audience of more than 240 million unique monthly visitors.

With a searchable database of more than 250 million items including about 4 million movies, TV and entertainment programs, 7.5 million cast and crew members and almost 67 million registered users, consumers rely on the information IMDb provides to check local movie showtimes, trailers, reviews by both critics and other users, personalized recommendations, photo galleries, news and so much more, using it to decide what to watch and where to watch it.

IMDb is the largest movie and TV fan community where registered users can submit new website content, ask for existing content revisions, rate movies, tv series and episodes, post reviews, gather in topic related discussion forums and create and manage personal lists.

### Problem

IMDb’s website design hasn’t changed much over the years, which is noticeable not only visually but also interaction wise. Surprisingly, to this day, the website still isn’t responsive, even though it has a mobile version and a mobile app, both for smartphone and tablet.
<br></br>

</p>
<br></br>

Beyond the website, it’s identity is dated and suggests some stagnation and lack of dynamics, despite the website's very active community.

### Redesign Goals and Scope

With a new identity and Website, IMDb can reaffirm itself as a credible and comprehensive online source, but also as a reliable and competent repository, capable of helping it’s users search for information on movies, tv shows and people (celebrities), and suggesting them relevant content.

__Main Goals:__

* Enhance the website's usability and navigation capabilities;
* Reaffirm the website as a permanently updated reference for movies;
* Reinvent the Company’s brand, making it more dynamic and current;
* Increase the number of registered users and active participants.

<br></br>

Due to the extension of the website, only a few page typologies were redesigned. New designs were developed for the **homepage**, **search**, **movie page** and **celebrity page**, with two variations: [Desktop]( https://filipago.github.io/imdb-redesign-desktop-site-prototype/) and [Mobile]( https://filipago.github.io/imdb-redesign-mobile-site-prototype)

### Methodology

#### Research

I kicked off this project by conducting a benchmarking analysis on 3 competitors’ websites:
* Rotten Tomatoes
* Metacritic
* The Movie DB

<br></br>

Benchmarking Analysis Table.
</p>
<br></br>

Looking at the competition, it was clear that even though IMDb was by far the most comprehensive movie database, it had to step up its game in terms of clearness, usability and polish.

All three competitor websites were easier to navigate, more organized and cleaner, specially The Movie DB, which is a great example of a website that has a lot of content, but doesn’t really distract the user from its goal, as the main navigation is quite simple and the content related to what the user is seeing can be accessed through body links that appear contextually. Not only does this enable a more fluid and effective navigation but it also increases the number of page views per user, which ultimately benefits the website’s owners.

</p>
<br></br>

I carried on with a SWOT Analysis on IMDB’s website and came to the conclusion that its major **strength** is the richness and diversity of the information it provides, the most notable **weakness** is the complexity of the site’s navigation, the best **opportunity** is offering worldwide access to shopping movies and tv series through Amazon’s website directly from IMDb (IMDb was acquired as an Amazon subsidiary private company in 1998), and its biggest **threat** is the emergence of competing databases with increased functionality and more easily accessible via mobile devices.

<br></br>

IMDb’s users can be quite diverse. With over 240 million unique monthly visitors, IMDb serves both hardcore movie buffs and casual users, who drop by intentionally (direct URL, social media…) or through a Google search, while looking for information on a movie/tv related topic.

<br></br>

</p>
<br></br>

In fact, if you run a Google search on a movie, tv show, actor, director or anything movie/tv related, chances are you will see IMDb consistently popping in the top 3 search results.

So… who are these people? 🤔

Due to time constraints my user research was mostly done online and talking with some friends.

The 3 proto-personas that seemed to fit my research, helped me develop a sense of empathy for the users and allowed me to think about which actions people might want to take most urgently so I could later provide them the most relevant content first.

<br></br>

<br></br>

Through this process, I was able to identify IMDb’s main target-audience: individuals who love the movies, enjoy watching trailers and keeping up with the latest premieres and news.

#### Interaction Design

Following the research phase, I did an overall Content Inventory using IMDb’s Site Index, that could later help me redesign the whole site’s Information Architecture and main navigation, as well as prioritize content.

Documenting every little content detail on the Homepage, Movie Page and Celebrity Page was a heavy task!

<br></br>
<p align="center">

<br></br>

Documenting the current website’s information architecture confirmed that the way the main navigation was organized didn’t look fitting as it combined options on the top level menu that didn’t seem to relate very well.

<br></br>

<br></br>

I refined the demographic and behavioral proto-personas’ characters and went on creating user flows.

<br></br>
<p align="center">

User Flows. Larger images can be found <a href="https://github.com/FilipaGo/imdb-redesign-mobile-site-prototype/tree/master/_images_readme/personas_userflows" >here</a>.</p>
<br></br>

Looking at the original Information Architecture I noticed that grouping together very large subjects into a single menu option raised the number of second-level options, increasing the navigation’s complexity.

To solve this issue, the new information architecture separates “movies” from “tv shows” and “community” from “news”, as these are very different subjects. I also created a top-level menu option just for “celebrities”.

I chose to name the “news” menu entry “news and events”, placing the “events” that were grouped with “celebrities” together with the “news”. It just seemed more fittings as contents published under “events” are usually news about awards’ ceremonies and film festivals.

<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/imdb-redesign-mobile-site-prototype/master/_images_readme/imdb_info-architecture_new01.jpg" width="1000" />
To move things around with ease and iterate faster, I decided to first use a spreadsheet to design IMDb's new Information Architecture.

<br></br>

By adjusting the top level menu, I was able to redesign a more consistent and simple main navigation, substantially reducing the complexity of the unfolded menu.

<br></br>

IMDb's new Main Navigation. Makes more sense, right?</p>
<br></br>

The main navigation was built upon my user research and perception of what most people might look for at IMDb’s website, as I wasn’t given access to any analytical data that could allow me to effectively know which menu options are most clicked and which contents are most sought after.

More on IMDb's redesign coming soon! 🚧
