Homepage Redesign (mobile and desktop)

<br></br>

## Project Summary

Project developed under the Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design which consisted in redesigning IMDb’s website, for desktop and mobile, in order to enhance the website's usability and navigation capabilities, reinvent the Company’s brand and increase the number of registered users and active participants.

To redesign the navigation, search, homepage, movie page and celebrity page, I mapped out the following strategy:

* Research (Benchmarking Analysis, SWOT Analysis, Proto-personas);
* Interaction Design (User Flows, Documenting the current website’s Information Architecture and Content Inventory – as-is analysis –, new Information Architecture, Wireframes);
* Rebranding;
* User Interface Design (Mockups Design and non-functional Prototype).

## Project Case Study

### Context

IMDb was first built in 1990, as a hobby, by a group of international tv and movies aficionados. Currently, it is the world's most popular and comprehensive internet source for finding information on movies, TV shows and celebrity related content.

According to Alexa, in October 2016, IMDb was the 57th most visited website in the world and number 1 movie website, with a combined web and mobile audience of more than 240 million unique monthly visitors.

With a searchable database of more than 250 million items including about 4 million movies, TV and entertainment programs, 7.5 million cast and crew members and almost 67 million registered users, consumers rely on the information IMDb provides to check local movie showtimes, trailers, reviews by both critics and other users, personalized recommendations, photo galleries, news and so much more, using it to decide what to watch and where to watch it.

IMDb is the largest movie and TV fan community where registered users can submit new website content, ask for existing content revisions, rate movies, tv series and episodes, post reviews, gather in topic related discussion forums and create and manage personal lists.

### Problem

IMDb’s website design hasn’t changed much over the years, which is noticeable not only visually but also interaction wise. Surprisingly, to this day, the website still isn’t responsive, even though it has a mobile version and a mobile app, both for smartphone and tablet.

Beyond the website, it’s identity is dated and suggests some stagnation and lack of dynamics, despite the website's very active community.

### Redesign Goals and Scope

With a new identity and Website, IMDb can reaffirm itself as a credible and comprehensive online source, but also as a reliable and competent repository, capable of helping it’s users search for information on movies, tv shows and people (celebrities), and suggesting them relevant content.

__Main Goals:__

* Enhance the website's usability and navigation capabilities;
* Reaffirm the website as a permanently updated reference for movies;
* Reinvent the Company’s brand, making it more dynamic and current;
* Increase the number of registered users and active participants.

Due to the extension of the website, only a few page typologies were redesigned. New designs were developed for the **homepage**, **search**, **movie page** and **celebrity page**, with two variations: [Desktop]( https://filipago.github.io/imdb-redesign-desktop-site-prototype/) and [Mobile]( https://filipago.github.io/imdb-redesign-mobile-site-prototype)

### Methodology
